# ansible
Place for all of my projects' Ansible goodies.

This playbook is based off of a blog post by Alexey Nizhegolenko about how to setup Grafana and InfluxDB with docker.
It is a very informative piece in getting a system monitoring solution up and running.  Thanks for the help, Alexey!

The link to Mr. Nizhegolenko's blog can be found below:

I have merely ported Alexey's instructions so that Ansible executes them.  My next steps to making it my own are in the TODO list.
