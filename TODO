TODO:

- Re-organize the playbook into roles

- For the love of all things holy, learn how to use variables.

- Create a playbook that only deploys the InfluxDB and Telegraf configurations.  Maybe make two roles,
  One that sets up grafana and the other that sets up influxdb?

- Create an influxdb playbook that is aware of an existing Grafana configuration.
  Bonus points if the playbook reconfigures the Grafana server to accept the new influxdb host as a 
  data source.
  
- Host this beautiful mess in Azure or AWS.

- improve error handling, specifically for the task dealing with creating a docker network.
  It will produce an error if the network already exists, and the workaround is to simply continue 
  the playbook anyways.  Is there a more graceful solution?  This solution won't work for different
  situations.
